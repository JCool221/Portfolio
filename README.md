## How to
The links in the nav menu will take you to the appropriate links around the website.  They have nifty hover effects.  Other links around the webpage will take you other places as well.  Not all of them are implemented yet.  They still have more cool hover effects though.  All the social media links work.  I had created a twitter to include that.  I don't really like or use social media but it was fun to include the icons.
